public contains files
if you make a big change put below this line but above the next.

____________________________________________________________----
-Edit June 17: I added funtion to Student Queue, clicking on Student will display in StudentInfo Tab.
__________________________________________________________________
-Edit June 16: I added my index.html which is the instructor page but kept it seperate cuz didnt want to rewrite james's. I also added a js file that had all the script from instructor.html except 
the collapse queue option because I prefer having that in the nav bar and letting bootstrap handle the collapse functionality. I also added a css file that accidentally rewrote the css already in here, so I changed mine to updated-style.css and added the original back how it was. - Eli

-Edit June 17: I got all of the flex functionality to work so there should never be a scrollbar in right side of screen. I also blocked out the rest of where everything should go on the instructor page, feel free to fill out any of those unfinished areas/make them look nicer. -Eli


that way we can just read top down to undersand change.
