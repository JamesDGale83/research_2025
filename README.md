-Edit June 16: I added my index.html which is the instructor page but kept it seperate cuz didnt want to rewrite james's. I also added a js file that had all the script from instructor.html except 
the collapse queue option because I prefer having that in the nav bar and letting bootstrap handle the collapse functionality. I also added a css file that accidentally rewrote the css already in here, so I changed mine to updated-style.css and added the original back how it was. - Eli


that way we can just read top down to undersand change.
